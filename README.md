Problem statement:

Background removal and replacement is a fundamental problem in computer vision and 

image processing with applications in photography, video conferencing, augmented 

reality, and content creation. Traditional methods require manual segmentation or use 

chroma-keying (green screen), which is often inconvenient and expensive. Automated 

background segmentation aims to isolate the subject (usually a person) from the 

background without requiring special setups.

However, achieving accurate and real-time segmentation is challenging due to variations 

in lighting, complex backgrounds, and diverse poses. Deep learning models have made 

significant progress but often require heavy computational resources and large datasets. 

MediaPipe’s Selfie Segmentation provides a lightweight, real-time solution for 

segmenting a person from the background using a pretrained model optimized for mobile 

and edge devices.

The problem addressed in this project is how to effectively replace the background of a 

given image containing a person with a different background image using MediaPipe’s 

Selfie Segmentation, while maintaining high quality and smooth transitions. The solution 

should handle images with diverse backgrounds and produce visually appealing outputs. 

The project also involves optimizing the code to run efficiently on standard computers 

without specialized hardware. Moreover, it is crucial to ensure the segmentation mask is 

accurate enough to handle fine details such as hair and avoid artifacts during background 

replacement.
Abstract:

Background removal and replacement in images is a widely sought-after technique in 

computer vision, enabling applications ranging from virtual conferencing and augmented 

reality to creative photo editing. Traditional methods often require controlled 

environments such as green screens or manual segmentation, which are time-consuming 

and costly. Recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to automate this 

process with high accuracy. This project leverages MediaPipe’s Selfie Segmentation, a 

lightweight and efficient pretrained model optimized for person segmentation, to isolate 

the subject in an image and replace the background with a custom image. By combining 

this segmentation output with OpenCV for image processing, the system generates 

visually convincing results with minimal computational overhead. The approach 

eliminates the need for complex setups or extensive user intervention, making background 

replacement accessible to a broader range of users and devices.

The implementation involves processing an input image containing a person, generating a 

segmentation mask that identifies the foreground subject, and blending the original person 

with a new background image. The background is resized to match the person image 

dimensions to ensure seamless compositing. Alpha blending is applied to the segmentation 

mask to smooth edges and avoid harsh transitions, thereby improving the visual quality of 

the output. This method performs well under various lighting conditions and backgrounds, 

although challenges remain in handling fine details such as hair or semi-transparent 

regions. The project highlights the practical use of machine learning models in everyday 

multimedia applications and demonstrates how combining MediaPipe’s efficient 

segmentation with classical image processing techniques can deliver high-quality 

background replacement suitable for both static images and future real-time extensions.

Furthermore, this project underscores the importance of balancing accuracy and 

computational efficiency
Introduction:

Background replacement is an essential task in modern multimedia applications, including 

video conferencing, film production, and social media content creation. Traditionally, 

achieving a clean background swap required a controlled environment with a uniform 

background, like a green screen, and complex post-processing. With the advancement of 

computer vision and machine learning, automated segmentation techniques have become 

available to isolate humans from complex backgrounds in real time.
MediaPipe Selfie Segmentation is a state-of-the-art, pretrained machine learning model 

that can detect and segment people in images and videos with high accuracy and speed. It 

leverages deep neural networks optimized for lightweight deployment, making it suitable 

for desktop and mobile environments.

This project implements background replacement by integrating MediaPipe Selfie 

Segmentation with OpenCV, a popular computer vision library. The main steps include 

loading the person and background images, generating the segmentation mask, resizing 

and blending images, and displaying the result. This approach allows users to easily 

change backgrounds in photos without specialized equipment or software.

By automating the background removal process, this method saves time and enables 

creative flexibility. It can be used for virtual backgrounds during online meetings, 

removing unwanted background clutter, or artistic photo manipulations.

Challenges include handling fine details such as hair or translucent objects, ensuring 

smooth edges to avoid harsh cutouts, and managing various lighting conditions. This 

project lays a foundation for more advanced image and video editing applications by 

providing an accessible and efficient segmentation-based background replacement 

solution.

In addition to accurate segmentation, achieving efficient performance on consumer-grade 

hardware is a key focus of this project. MediaPipe Selfie Segmentation is specifically 

designed to be lightweight and fast, enabling real-time processing on devices ranging from 

smartphones to desktops without the need for powerful GPUs. This makes the technology 

highly accessible and suitable for integration into everyday applications such as video 

conferencing tools and social media filters. The project thus not only emphasizes accuracy 

but also prioritizes usability and speed, laying the groundwork for future enhancements 

including video background replacement and interactive augmented reality experiences.
Conclusion:

This project successfully demonstrates how MediaPipe Selfie Segmentation can be used to 

automatically remove and replace the background of images containing people. The 

solution provides a fast, effective, and user-friendly way to isolate the subject from complex 

backgrounds and composite a new background seamlessly. The use of a pretrained, 

lightweight model allows real-time or near-real-time processing on common hardware 

without requiring specialized GPUs or extensive training data. The integration with 

OpenCV facilitates image handling and visualization. While the method works well for 

many scenarios, improvements can be made to better handle fine details and complex 

backgrounds. Future work may include video processing, temporal smoothing, and 

enhanced edge refinement techniques. Overall, this approach expands the capabilities of 

image editing and virtual environments, offering significant potential for multimedia, 

communication, and creative industries.
